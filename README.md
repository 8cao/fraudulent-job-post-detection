# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fraudulent Job Postings Detection

Built a machine learning pipeline to detect online recruitment fraud by classifying real vs. fake job postings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The project combines text preprocessing, multiple vectorization methods (BoW, TF-IDF, GloVe, Word2Vec), and classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) to achieve high macro F1-scores while addressing class imbalance through SMOTE.

An interactive dashboard was also implemented using Dash to visualize model performance, topic distributions, and word embeddings.

## üìä Overview

- Analyzed job descriptions with NLP techniques to detect fraudulent postings.
- Used TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and LDA Topic Modeling for feature extraction.
- Achieved **90%+ F1-score** using Logistic Regression and SVM.
- Developed a dashboard in **Dash** to display insights and model performance.
